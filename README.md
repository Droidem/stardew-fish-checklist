# [Stardew Fish Checklist](http://theirondeveloper.com/stardew-fish-checklist/)

This is a simple polymer webapp that displays some helpful information for the game [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) (by ConcernedApe).

[Live Webapp Here](http://theirondeveloper.com/stardew-fish-checklist/)

Nearly all the data came from [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cr7p-d7OTLz3AMOB8vbU9bWvFWHmp7Evzm5RWaZr7vM/)
And all the image assets were pulled from [the stardew wiki](http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Fish)


I claim no ownership over any of the data or assets, this is just a side project intended to both help gamers maintain the
fish they caught, and serve as a nice polymer refresher for me (I haven't tinkered with it for a year, so I'm pokeing at
whats different).
